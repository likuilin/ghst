# Special transaction commands such as stock splits can be placed anywhere in the file and can be chronologically un-ordered.
# stock_tools will first read all regular stock transactions before processing commands. In the example commands
# below we specify 3 stock split events for QCOM and we deliberately list them chronologically un-ordered.
# For readability however, it would be recommended to place these commands in the time sequence of stock transactions above
